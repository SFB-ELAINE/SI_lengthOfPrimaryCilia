The file summary_cilia_edited.csv was created by copying and renaming summary_cilia.csv. Furthermore, the column "to_be_removed" was filled with "yes" if a particular cilium was seen as a false positive (by Kai) and no if it was seen as true positive. (This was done by a quick scan of the results and a plausibility check.)
